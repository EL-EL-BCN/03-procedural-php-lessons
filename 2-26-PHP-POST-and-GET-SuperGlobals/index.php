	<div><h3>We start with some simple HTML code within a form that creates a button. Note that the form method is GET which means that we can see the information that we want to retrieve from the URL. If we use POST then we donÂ´t see the information in the URL.</h3></div>

	<div><h3>We have set name to equal value with the input HTML code so when we pess the button we get code in the URL preceeded by a question mark. </h3></div>
